# Cocoapods

   pod 'FTFoldingTableView', '~> 0.0.2'



# Need to know

* 2016.06.21. I recently upgrade my XCode to 8.0 beta, so XCode version below 8.0 may not be able to open the storyboard or run the demo project. It will be fixed soon.
* I use two day to finish this project, and uploaded it to Cocoapods. Therefore I don't have enough time to test it, if you have any questions, please let me know. I'll fill this README in the near future.
